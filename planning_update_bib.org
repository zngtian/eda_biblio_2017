**** A latex work flow to generate an annotated bibliography
Here is a work flow for generating an annotated bibliography with
latex,
http://math.ucdenver.edu/~billups/courses/ma5779/annotated_bibliography.html. 

* Project Maintenance 

- The whole work of updating is maintained using Git and GitHub. The URL
  of the GitHub is https://github.com/zngtian/eda_biblio_2017.
- +Mendeley is used to manage bibliography items.+
- Mendeley does not support exporting with pdf files. Use Zotero,
  instead. 

* Files to work
** New bibtex file
We have created a new bibtex file to contain all bibliography items,
both old and new ones. The new bibtex file is
[[file:newdocs/regional_innovation.bib][/newdocs/regional_innovation.bib]]. 

** New LaTeX file
We use a latex file to rewrite the annotated bibliography. The latex
is [[file:newdocs/regional_innovation_annotate_bibliography.tex][/newdocs/regional_innovation_annotate_bibliography.tex]]. 

* New papers added
