	abstract = {Conventional wisdom about innovation was based on studies using the measure of input of innovation, such as R\&D expenditures, and the measure of the intermediate output in the process, such as the number of patented inventions. Recently, some new learning regarding technological change has emerged based on new data sources for the direct measure of innovative output. The purpose of this article is to summarize what has been learned from these new data sources, providing a direct measure of innovative output for the United States, and how these new measures have led to a new learning about the process of technological change.},

However, in practice, European policy relies more on long-established data for R\&D than the CIS.  This article is to examine why R\&D indicators still dominate innovation policy making in Europe and to make several suggestion for improving the usefulness of the CIS. This requires returning to some of the original goals of the CIS and using the CIS to construct new indicators that better meet the needs of the policy community. Several examples of new indicators are provided, including an output measure with better international comparability, an indicator for knowledge diffusion, and a set of indicators for firms’ innovative capabilities.},

	abstract = {Innovation systems can be defined in a variety of ways: they can be national, regional, sectoral, or technological. They all involve the creation, diffusion, and use of knowledge. Systems consist of components, relationships among these, and their characteristics or attributes.The focus of this paper is on the analytical and methodological issues arising from various system concepts. There are three issues that stand out as problematic. First, what is the appropriate level of analysis for the purpose at hand? It matters, for example, whether we are interested in a certain technology, product, set of related products, a competence bloc, a particular cluster of activities or firms, or the science and technology base generally—and for what geographic area, as well as for what time period. The choice of components and system boundaries depends on this, as does the type of interaction among components to be analyzed. The attributes or features of the system components that come into focus also depend on the choice of level of analysis.The second and closely related issue is how to determine the population, i.e. delineate the system and identify the actors and/or components. What are the key relationships that need to be captured so that the important interaction takes place within the system rather than outside?The third issue is how to measure the performance of the system. What is to be measured, and how can performance be measured at the system level rather than at component level?},

Building on the notion of regions as occupying different positions on a continuum referring to processes constituting them and their powers vis-à-vis innovation policy, the paper concludes by advocating strengthening of regional level capacities for promoting both systemic learning and interactive innovation.},

The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth analysis of the data provided by the first Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The article shows that the traditional north-south distinction does not give full account of the wider spectrum of regional patterns in Italy. In particular, regional innovative patterns differ not only according to the specific strategies and technological performances of firms, but also according to the relevance of systemic interactions and the presence of contextual factors favourable to innovation. However, proper regional systems of innovation are found only in a few well-defined areas. In most regions, systemic interactions and knowledge flows between the relevant actors are simply too sparse and too weak to reveal the presence of systems of innovation at work.},

Focuses on the features of the Japanese system of innovations and their implications for other countries, concentrating on the institutions and experience of Japan. Begins with an international comparison of some long-term trends in science and technology indicators for the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, such as trends in research and development, gaps in productivity and technology, rates of growth, and output measures for science and technology. Analyzes the Japanese national system of innovation. Features the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, company research and development, education and training and social innovation, and the conglomerate structure of industry. Stresses the importance of information and communications and describes the Japanese system of technological forecasting and diffusion of major changes in technology throughout the economy. Indicates some of the problems for the world economy and Japan arising from the success of its technology policies, such as imbalances in world trade creating a world protectionist sentiment.

The approach has shifted from solely a national perspective to one including regional or local systems. This focus on spatial aspects has two major advantages: it recognizes that innovation is a social process and a geographic process. For federations, the national system of innovation is more complex than that of a unitary system, since there are often provincial/state level institutions and actors that parallel national level institutions and actors. Canada is one of the few true economic and social (as well as political) federations in the developed world. Consequently, it provides a unique laboratory for studies on the processes of innovation in regions and regional innovation systems.

The article then refers to the a consolidation attempt on the part of Ericsson, which took place in Norway a few years ago, in order to illustrate both threats and possibilities for local industrial development in the global economy. This event includes the decision made by the transnational corporation Ericsson to relocate one of their development departments from a small Norwegian town to the capital region, and the later change of plan because very few of the engineers seem to be willing to move along with the department. Lastly, the article departs from the Ericsson event to discuss, from the regional innovation system perspective, possible development policies to anchor units of transnational corporations to a local area.},

Describes the problematic aspects of the postwar paradigm that basic science can serve as a pacemaker of technological progress only if it is insulated from thought of practical use. Addresses the paradox of how this vision of science and its role in technological innovation could have prevailed, given that those who built modern science were so often influenced by applied goals. Sets out a more realistic view of the links between basic science and technological innovation that is more faithful to the history of research. Considers renewing the compact between science and government. Considers a process by which American democracy could build agendas of use-inspired basic research by bringing together judgments of research promise and societal need. The late Donald E. Stokes was Professor of Politics and Public Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. Index.},

Context-specific and customized score-boards show promise as a structuring tool in informed debate, indicator selection, comparative analysis and benchmarking studies of research excellence. Guidelines and recommendations are illustrated by way of a fictitious scoreboard with recent empirical data for economics research at the universities in the Netherlands.},

The most relevant aspects of RSIs, from the evaluation perspective, relate to their largely tacit and context‐specific character. In this paper, the concept and characteristics of RSIs are reviewed, and the implications of these for evaluation practice are discussed. Pointers for good practice in the evaluation of RTD in RSIs are listed.},

It presents an overview of the development of science and technology (S\&T) indicators and their use in national policy making and provides evidence of the vulnerability of composite S\&T indicators to manipulation. A brief history of the development of S\&T indicators begins with the role of the United States followed by their worldwide diffusion with particular emphasis on Europe. Newer developments towards composite indicators, benchmarking and scoreboarding are discussed. To investigate the robustness of innovation scoreboards empirically, a sensitivity analysis of one selected case is presented. It is shown that composite scores and country rank positions can vary considerably depending on the selection process. Thus, the use of scoreboards leaves room for manipulation in the policymaking system. Further research is needed on alternative methods of calculation to prevent their misuse and abuse.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the transfer and sharing of knowledge within and between regions in the context of the development of the international economy. It is argued that knowledge is a key resource for innovation which, in turn, is one of the major drivers of economic growth. The firms producing the most novel product innovations in the most significant regional concentrations of innovation are very adept at working across the interface of local and global knowledge transfers. Using data from previous studies combined with the latest regional data from the Community Innovation Survey 3, comparisons are made between the ways in which the most innovative firms in the Greater South East transfer and share knowledge from the local to the international level. The most innovative firms are shown to access international sources of knowledge. This raises questions over the relative importance of local versus international knowledge spillovers for the most innovative firms. Innovative firms tend to concentrate in a minority of key metropolitan regions. These are shown to combine a strong local knowledge capital base with high levels of connectivity to similar regions in the international economy. In this way they are able to combine and decode both codified and tacit knowledge originating from multiple regional, national and international sources. As a result they are able to generate virtuous circles of knowledge, innovation, competitiveness and exports.},

Although the process of innovation is a crucial aspect of economic growth, the problem of measuring innovation has not yet been completely resolved.

Determining the extent to which the innovation data can be substituted by other measures is essential for a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved. We provide an exploratory and a regression-based comparison of the innovation count data and data on patent counts at the lowest possible levels of geographical aggregation.},
