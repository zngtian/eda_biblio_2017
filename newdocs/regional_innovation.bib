For these tasks, the article suggests definitions of central concepts as regional clusters, regional innovations systems and systems barriers that emphasis the importance of "non-economic" factors to a much larger extent than typically found in the Porterian approach. The article then refers to the a consolidation attempt on the part of Ericsson, which took place in Norway a few years ago, in order to illustrate both threats and possibilities for local industrial development in the global economy. This event includes the decision made by the transnational corporation Ericsson to relocate one of their development departments from a small Norwegian town to the capital region, and the later change of plan because very few of the engineers seem to be willing to move along with the department. Lastly, the article departs from the Ericsson event to discuss, from the regional innovation system perspective, possible development policies to anchor units of transnational corporations to a local area.},

	abstract = {The concept of national innovation systems was first developed to describe the process of innovation in developed economies. The approach has shifted from solely a national perspective to one including regional or local systems. This focus on spatial aspects has two major advantages: it recognizes that innovation is a social process and a geographic process. For federations, the national system of innovation is more complex than that of a unitary system, since there are often provincial/state level institutions and actors that parallel national level institutions and actors. Canada is one of the few true economic and social (as well as political) federations in the developed world. Consequently, it provides a unique laboratory for studies on the processes of innovation in regions and regional innovation systems. This paper reports on the initial results of research on the characteristics of industrial clusters being carried out through the (Canadian) Innovation Systems Research Network - ISRN.},

It presents an overview of the development of science and technology (S\&T) indicators and their use in national policy making and provides evidence of the vulnerability of composite S\&T indicators to manipulation. A brief history of the development of S\&T indicators begins with the role of the United States followed by their worldwide diffusion with particular emphasis on Europe. Newer developments towards composite indicators. benchmarking and scoreboarding are discussed. To investigate the robustness of innovation scoreboards, empirically, a sensitivity analysis of one selected case is presented. It is shown that composite scores and country rank positions can vary considerably depending on the selection process. Thus, the use of scoreboards leaves room for manipulation in the policymaking system. Further research is needed on alternative methods of calculation to prevent their misuse and abuse.

	abstract = {This article addresses a set of issues that were central to Keith Pavitt's research. that is. the construction and use of tools to measure national innovative performance and to design national policies relating to innovation. It presents an overview of the development of science and technology (S\&T) indicators and their use in national policy making and provides evidence of the vulnerability of composite S\&T indicators to manipulation. A brief history of the development of S\&T indicators begins with the role of the United States followed by their worldwide diffusion with particular emphasis on Europe. Newer developments towards composite indicators. benchmarking and scoreboarding are discussed. To investigate the robustness of innovation scoreboards, empirically, a sensitivity analysis of one selected case is presented. It is shown that composite scores and country rank positions can vary considerably depending on the selection process. Thus, the use of scoreboards leaves room for manipulation in the policymaking system. Further research is needed on alternative methods of calculation to prevent their misuse and abuse.

Although the process of innovation is a crucial aspect of economic growth, the problem of measuring innovation has not yet been completely resolved. A central problem involved in such analysis is the measurement of economically useful new knowledge. In the US information on this has been limited to an innovation count data base. Determining the extent to which the innovation data can be substituted by other measures is essential for a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved. We provide an exploratory and a regression-based comparison of the innovation count data and data on patent counts at the lowest possible levels of geographical aggregation.

	abstract = {This paper examines the transfer and sharing of knowledge within and between regions in the context of the development of the international economy. It is argued that knowledge is a key resource for innovation which, in turn, is one of the major drivers of economic growth. The firms producing the most novel product innovations in the most significant regional concentrations of innovation are very adept at working across the interface of local and global knowledge transfers. Using data from previous studies combined with the latest regional data from the Community Innovation Survey 3, comparisons are made between the ways in which the most innovative firms in the Greater South East transfer and share knowledge from the local to the international level. The most innovative firms are shown to access international sources of knowledge. This raises questions over the relative importance of local versus international knowledge spillovers for the most innovative firms. Innovative firms tend to concentrate in a minority of key metropolitan regions. These are shown to combine a strong local knowledge capital base with high levels of connectivity to similar regions in the international economy. In this way they are able to combine and decode both codified and tacit knowledge originating from multiple regional, national and international sources. As a result they are able to generate virtuous circles of knowledge, innovation, competitiveness and exports.},

Systems consist of components, relationships among these, and their characteristics or attributes. The focus of this paper is on the analytical and methodological issues arising from various system concepts. There are three issues that stand out as problematic. First, what is the appropriate level of analysis for the purpose at hand? It matters, for example, whether we are interested in a certain technology, product, set of related products, a competence bloc, a particular cluster of activities or firms, or the science and technology base generally—and for what geographic area, as well as for what time period. The choice of components and system boundaries depends on this, as does the type of interaction among components to be analyzed. The attributes or features of the system components that come into focus also depend on the choice of level of analysis. The second and closely related issue is how to determine the population, i.e. delineate the system and identify the actors and/or components. What are the key relationships that need to be captured so that the important interaction takes place within the system rather than outside? The third issue is how to measure the performance of the system. What is to be measured, and how can performance be measured at the system level rather than at component level?},

Focuses on the features of the Japanese system of innovations and their implications for other countries, concentrating on the institutions and experience of Japan. Begins with an international comparison of some long-term trends in science and technology indicators for the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, such as trends in research and development, gaps in productivity and technology, rates of growth, and output measures for science and technology. Analyzes the Japanese national system of innovation. Features the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, company research and development, education and training and social innovation, and the conglomerate structure of industry. Stresses the importance of information and communications and describes the Japanese system of technological forecasting and diffusion of major changes in technology throughout the economy. Indicates some of the problems for the world economy and Japan arising from the success of its technology policies, such as imbalances in world trade creating a world protectionist sentiment.

The dramatic growth over the last 20 years in the use of science, technology and innovation (STI) indicators appears first and foremost to be the result of a combination of, on the one hand, the ease of computerized access to an increasing number of measures of STI and, on the other hand, the interest in a growing number of public policy and private business circles in such indicators. Such growing interest might be expected in societies that increasingly use organised science and technology to achieve a wide variety of social and economic objectives and in which business competition is increasingly based on innovation. On the basis of 40 years of indicators work, we argue that frontiers and characteristics of STI indicators that were important last century may no longer be so relevant today and indeed may even be positively misleading.},

This book is about these national systems of technical innovation. The heart of the work contains studies of seventeen countries--from large market-oriented industrialized ones to several smaller high income ones, including a number of newly industrialized states as well. Clearly written, this work highlights institutions and mechanisms which support technical innovation, showing similarities, differences, and their sources across nations, making this work accessible to students as well as the scholars of innovation.},

The purpose of Professor Rosenberg's work is to break open and examine the contents of the black box. In so doing, a number of important economic problems be powerfully illuminated. The author clearly shows how specific features of individual technologies have shaped a number of variables of great concern to economists: the rate of productivity improvement, the nature of learning processes underlying technological change itself, the speed of technology transfer, and the effectiveness of government policies that are intended to influence technologies in particular ways. The separate chapters of this book reflect a primary concern with some of the distinctive aspects of industrial technologies in the twentieth century, such as the increasing reliance upon science, but also the considerable subtlety and complexity of the dialectic between science and technology. Other concerns include the rapid growth in the development of costs associated with new technologies as well as the difficulty of predicting the eventual performance characteristics of newly emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {Over fifty years ago, Vannevar Bush released his enormously influential report, Science, the Endless Frontier, which asserted a dichotomy between basic and applied science. This view was at the core of the compact between government and science that led to the golden age of scientific research after World War II—a compact that is currently under severe stress. In this book, Donald Stokes challenges Bush's view and maintains that we can only rebuild the relationship between government and the scientific community when we understand what is wrong with that view.Stokes begins with an analysis of the goals of understanding and use in scientific research. He recasts the widely accepted view of the tension between understanding and use, citing as a model case the fundamental yet use-inspired studies by which Louis Pasteur laid the foundations of microbiology a century ago. Pasteur worked in the era of the "second industrial revolution," when the relationship between basic science and technological change assumed its modern form. Over subsequent decades, technology has been increasingly science-based. But science has been increasingly technology-based--with the choice of problems and the conduct of research often inspired by societal needs. An example is the work of the quantum-effects physicists who are probing the phenomena revealed by the miniaturization of semiconductors from the time of the transistor's discovery after World War II.On this revised, interactive view of science and technology, Stokes builds a convincing case that by recognizing the importance of use-inspired basic research we can frame a new compact between science and government. His conclusions have major implications for both the scientific and policy communities and will be of great interest to those in the broader public who are troubled by the current role of basic science in American democracy.},

The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth analysis of the data provided by the first Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The article shows that the traditional north-south distinction does not give full account of the wider spectrum of regional patterns in Italy. In particular, regional innovative patterns differ not only according to the specific strategies and technological performances of firms, but also according to the relevance of systemic interactions and the presence of contextual factors favourable to innovation. However, proper regional systems of innovation are found only in a few well-defined areas. In most regions, systemic interactions and knowledge flows between the relevant actors are simply too sparse and too weak to reveal the presence of systems of innovation at work.},

(2) External contacts, outside of the local industrial milieu, are crucial in innovation processes also in many SMEs. (3) Innovation processes may nevertheless be regarded as regional phenomena in regional clusters, as regional resources and collaborative networks often have decisive significance for firms' innovation activity.

The role of power within regional firm networks is noted in empirical studies but insufficiently theorized. It is suggested that network functioning is conflictual and that more powerful network members, particularly transnational corporations (TNCs), leverage regional resources to advance their sustainable competitive advantage. The agendas and power exercised by TNCs within regionalized firm networks have significant implications for regional policy and the uneven allocation of resources and capacities within and among regions. The findings indicate that transnational firm access to resources that are critical to innovation, including university research and skilled labour, negatively affects the potential for innovation by small and medium-size firms.

Le rôle du pouvoir au sein des réseaux d'entreprise régionaux est noté dans les études empiriques mais reste insuffisamment étayé dans la théorie. On laisse supposer que le fonctionnement des réseaux est en conflit et que les membres du réseau plus puissants, notamment les sociétés transnationales, augmentent le ratio d'endettement à partir des ressources régionales afin d'avancer leur avantage compétitif durable. Les programmes et le pouvoir exercés par les sociétés transnationales au sein des réseaux d'entreprise régionalisés ont des retombées non-négligeables pour la politique régionale et la distribution irrégulière des ressources et des capacités intrarégionales et interrégionales. Les résultats laissent indiquer que l'accès des sociétés transnationales aux ressources qui sont essentielles pour assurer l'innovation, y compris la recherche universitaire et l'emploi qualifié, touche de façon négative le potentiel d'innovation des petites et moyennes entreprises.

	abstract = {Baden-Württemberg's innovation system, which is characterised by a high degree of institutionalisation as well as a predominance of incremental innovations and medium technology finds itself in a profound process of transition. The paper discusses whether Baden-Württemberg's strength as an industrial district dominated by mature industries is an impediment or rather an asset with regard to developing new promising technological sectors in the region. The paper focuses on two newly emerging sectors: multimedia and biotechnology. Because of the strong orientation of actors in Baden-Württemberg to established companies in the core industries and the dominance of established organizational networks there is a lack of stimuli for developing new industries. Thus, institutional innovation and new networks are required to speed up the growth of the new industries. Baden-Württemberg can be expected to cope with the transition to the extent that it builds a close connection between its existing sectoral strengths and the new growth industries.},

	abstract = {Regional innovation system (RIS) is the new research field of modern economic geography in the age of knowledge economy. Based on the researches of regional economic geography, the authors of the paper consider RIS as the integrated and interactive systems with innovation milieu, elements, units, structure and functions. Five aspects of evaluation indicators including innovation input scale and output scale, innovation milieu transition, innovation inner operation, as well as innovation outer impact are worked out for final indicators of RIS scale and quality. According to different RIS situations, three patterns of independent, imitative and cooperative development are put forward for choosing. At the latter part of the paper, we select 12 provincial regions (including three municipalities and one autonomous region) of China for empirical study. The results show that there exists great difference among each region from the aspects of innovation scale and quality mainly owning to the diversification of RIS social and economic milieu, the major innovative units of enterprises, universities and R\&D institutes. Finally, the paper points out the innovation development decisions for each region.},

	abstract = {Creative destruction is a central element of the competitive dynamic of capitalism. This phenomenon assumes concrete form in relation to specific geographical and historical conditions. One such set of conditions is investigated here under the rubric of the creative field, i.e. the locationally-differentiated web of production activities and associated social relationships that shapes patterns of entrepreneurship and innovation in the new economy. The creative field operates at many different levels of scale, but I argue that the urban and regional scale is of special interest and significance. Accordingly, I go on to describe how the creative field functions as a site of (a) entrepreneurial behavior and new firm formation, (b) technical and organizational change, and (c) the symbolic elaboration and re-elaboration of cultural products. All of these activities are deeply structured by relations of spatial-cum-organizational proximity and separation in the system of production. The creative field, however, is far from being a fully self-organizing entity, and it is susceptible to various kinds of breakdowns and distortions. Several policy issues raised by these problems are examined. The paper ends by addressing the question as to whether industrial agglomeration is an effect of producers’ search for creative synergies, or whether such synergies are themselves simply a contingent outcome of agglomeration.},
