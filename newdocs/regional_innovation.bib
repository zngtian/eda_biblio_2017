  abstract =	 {This paper examines the transfer and sharing of
                  knowledge within and between regions in the context
                  of the development of the international economy. It
                  is argued that knowledge is a key resource for
                  innovation which, in turn, is one of the major
                  drivers of economic growth. The firms producing the
                  most novel product innovations in the most
                  significant regional concentrations of innovation
                  are very adept at working across the interface of
                  local and global knowledge transfers. Using data
                  from previous studies combined with the latest
                  regional data from the Community Innovation Survey
                  3, comparisons are made between the ways in which
                  the most innovative firms in the Greater South East
                  transfer and share knowledge from the local to the
                  international level. The most innovative firms are
                  shown to access international sources of
                  knowledge. This raises questions over the relative
                  importance of local versus international knowledge
                  spillovers for the most innovative firms. Innovative
                  firms tend to concentrate in a minority of key
                  metropolitan regions. These are shown to combine a
                  strong local knowledge capital base with high levels
                  of connectivity to similar regions in the
                  international economy. In this way they are able to
                  combine and decode both codified and tacit knowledge
                  originating from multiple regional, national and
                  international sources. As a result they are able to
                  generate virtuous circles of knowledge, innovation,
                  competitiveness and exports.},
