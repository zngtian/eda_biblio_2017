abstract = {Being first introduced in 1993, the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) is considered one of the most comprehensive major sources of new innovation data at the time. However, in practice, European policy relies more on long-established data for R{\&}D than the CIS.  This article is to examine why R{\&}D indicators still dominate innovation policy making in Europe and to make several suggestion for improving the usefulness of the CIS. This requires returning to some of the original goals of the CIS and using the CIS to construct new indicators that better meet the needs of the policy community. Several examples of new indicators are provided, including an output measure with better international comparability, an indicator for knowledge diffusion, and a set of indicators for firms' innovative capabilities. },

abstract = {This article addresses a set of issues that were central to Keith Pavitt's research. that is. the construction and use of tools to measure national innovative performance and to design national policies relating to innovation. It presents an overview of the development of science and technology (S{\&}T) indicators and their use in national policy making and provides evidence of the vulnerability of composite S{\&}T indicators to manipulation. A brief history of the development of S{\&}T indicators begins with the role of the United States followed by their worldwide diffusion with particular emphasis on Europe. Newer developments towards composite indicators. benchmarking and scoreboarding are discussed. To investigate the robustness of innovation scoreboards, empirically, a sensitivity analysis of one selected case is presented. It is shown that composite scores and country rank positions can vary considerably depending on the selection process. Thus, the use of scoreboards leaves room for manipulation in the policymaking system. Further research is needed on alternative methods of calculation to prevent their misuse and abuse.

abstract = {This paper examines the transfer and sharing of knowledge within and between regions in the context of the development of the international economy. It is argued that knowledge is a key resource for innovation which, in turn, is one of the major drivers of economic growth. The firms producing the most novel product innovations in the most significant regional concentrations of innovation are very adept at working across the interface of local and global knowledge transfers. Using data from previous studies combined with the latest regional data from the Community Innovation Survey 3, comparisons are made between the ways in which the most innovative firms in the Greater South East transfer and share knowledge from the local to the international level. The most innovative firms are shown to access international sources of knowledge. This raises questions over the relative importance of local versus international knowledge spillovers for the most innovative firms. Innovative firms tend to concentrate in a minority of key metropolitan regions. These are shown to combine a strong local knowledge capital base with high levels of connectivity to similar regions in the international economy. In this way they are able to combine and decode both codified and tacit knowledge originating from multiple regional, national and international sources. As a result they are able to generate virtuous circles of knowledge, innovation, competitiveness and exports.},

For these tasks, the article suggests definitions of central concepts as regional clusters, regional innovations systems and systems barriers that emphasis the importance of "non-economic" factors to a much larger extent than typically found in the Porterian approach. The article then refers to the a consolidation attempt on the part of Ericsson, which took place in Norway a few years ago, in order to illustrate both threats and possibilities for local industrial development in the global economy. This event includes the decision made by the transnational corporation Ericsson to relocate one of their development departments from a small Norwegian town to the capital region, and the later change of plan because very few of the engineers seem to be willing to move along with the department. Lastly, the article departs from the Ericsson event to discuss, from the regional innovation system perspective, possible development policies to anchor units of transnational corporations to a local area.},

The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth analysis of the data provided by the first Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The article shows that the traditional north-south distinction does not give full account of the wider spectrum of regional patterns in Italy. In particular, regional innovative patterns differ not only according to the specific strategies and technological performances of firms, but also according to the relevance of systemic interactions and the presence of contextual factors favourable to innovation. However, proper regional systems of innovation are found only in a few well-defined areas. In most regions, systemic interactions and knowledge flows between the relevant actors are simply too sparse and too weak to reveal the presence of systems of innovation at work.},

Acknowledging the major contribution of research on National Innovation Systems, it suggests that for conceptual and methodological reasons, mostly concerning problems of scale and complexity, that approach may be complemented in important ways by a subnational focus. Taking an evolutionary economics standpoint, the paper specifies the concepts of 'region,' 'innovation' and 'system' as the prelude to an extended discussion of the importance of financial capacity, institutionalised learning and productive culture to systemic innovation. Building on the notion of regions as occupying different positions on a continuum referring to processes constituting them and their powers vis-{\`{a}}-vis innovation policy, the paper concludes by advocating strengthening of regional level capacities for promoting both systemic learning and interactive innovation.},

abstract = {Innovation systems can be defined in a variety of ways: they can be national, regional, sectoral, or technological. They all involve the creation, diffusion, and use of knowledge. Systems consist of components, relationships among these, and their characteristics or attributes.The focus of this paper is on the analytical and methodological issues arising from various system concepts. There are three issues that stand out as problematic. First, what is the appropriate level of analysis for the purpose at hand? It matters, for example, whether we are interested in a certain technology, product, set of related products, a competence bloc, a particular cluster of activities or firms, or the science and technology base generally—and for what geographic area, as well as for what time period. The choice of components and system boundaries depends on this, as does the type of interaction among components to be analyzed. The attributes or features of the system components that come into focus also depend on the choice of level of analysis.The second and closely related issue is how to determine the population, i.e. delineate the system and identify the actors and/or components. What are the key relationships that need to be captured so that the important interaction takes place within the system rather than outside?The third issue is how to measure the performance of the system. What is to be measured, and how can performance be measured at the system level rather than at component level?},

SISs utilize spatial divisions of labor among several specialized RISs, possibly in more than one NIS. The SIS concept emphasizes the external relations of actors as key elements that transcend all existing systems of innovation. The integrating role of these relations remains inadequately understood to date. This poses a challenge for future research.},

The innovation capacities of the metropolitan innovation systems differ markedly. In respect to cooperation partners, vertical relationships predominate. Only in Stockholm do research institutes play a significant role in assisting innovation processes in manufacturing firms. Spatial proximity of cooperation partners is very important, confirming the concept of territorially based systems of innovation. At the same time, the actors surveyed cooperate intensively with cooperation partners outside the region.},

abstract = {Proposes a revised view of the relationship between basic science and technological innovation and shows how this revision could lead to a clearer view of several aspects of science and technology policy. Describes the problematic aspects of the postwar paradigm that basic science can serve as a pacemaker of technological progress only if it is insulated from thought of practical use. Addresses the paradox of how this vision of science and its role in technological innovation could have prevailed, given that those who built modern science were so often influenced by applied goals. Sets out a more realistic view of the links between basic science and technological innovation that is more faithful to the history of research. Considers renewing the compact between science and government. Considers a process by which American democracy could build agendas of use-inspired basic research by bringing together judgments of research promise and societal need. The late Donald E. Stokes was Professor of Politics and Public Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. Index.},

abstract = {The paper examines how firms in three regional clusters in Norway dominated by shipbuilding, mechanical engineering and electronics industry, respectively exploit both place-specific local resources as well as external, world-class knowledge to strengthen their competitiveness. From these case-studies we make four points: (1) ideal-typical regional innovation systems, i.e., regional clusters "surrounded" by supporting local organisations, is rather uncommon in Norway; (2) external contacts, outside of the local industrial milieu, are crucial in innovation processes also in many SMEs; (3) innovation processes may nevertheless be regarded as regional phenomena in regional clusters, as regional resources and collaborative networks often have decisive significance for firms' innovation activity; and (4) regional resources include in particular place-specific, contextual knowledge of both tacit and codified nature, that, in combination, is rather geographically immobile.},
